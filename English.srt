00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,377
<font color="#00ffff">There you go.</font>

2
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,049
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

3
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,517
<font color="#00ffff">Piece of shit.</font>

4
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,473
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana Steel?</font>

5
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,777
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

6
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,257
<font color="#00ffff">Good luck in your new job</font>

7
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,540
<font color="#00ffff">Good morning, Mr. Heim.</font>

8
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,776
<font color="#00ffff">No, please, just Jack.</font>

9
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,778
<font color="#00ffff">Are you green or black?</font>

10
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,615
<font color="#00ffff">I'm pretty sure I should
look for you, but thank you.</font>

11
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,267
<font color="#00ffff">This is incredible.</font>

12
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,104
<font color="#00ffff">It's all corals and turtles and drinks.</font>

13
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,307
<font color="#00ffff">You should be here.
Because you are not here?</font>

14
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,444
<font color="#00ffff">Tell my brother's asshole
to give you the day off.</font>

15
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,714
<font color="#00ffff">Goodbye, Mariana</font>

16
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,959
<font color="#00ffff">Do you need me?</font>

17
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,195
<font color="#00ffff">No, I can wait.</font>

18
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,931
<font color="#00ffff">- It's okay.
- You look good. Are you going out?</font>

19
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:29,570
<font color="#00ffff">A friend of mine has an inauguration
of a photography exhibition today, so</font>

20
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,871
<font color="#00ffff">Can i go</font>

21
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,105
<font color="#00ffff">Good.</font>

22
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,441
<font color="#00ffff">How did the manuscripts go?</font>

23
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,510
<font color="#00ffff">Very well, actually.</font>

24
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,648
<font color="#00ffff">This, Voice Fox, could
not stop reading it.</font>

25
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:45,018
<font color="#00ffff">It is so sharp and relevant.</font>

26
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,452
<font color="#00ffff">I think you really have something.</font>

27
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,322
<font color="#00ffff">- Do you believe it?
- Yes.</font>

28
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,291
<font color="#00ffff">- I'll check it out,
- It's okay.</font>

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,845
<font color="#00ffff">- Have fun tonight, Mariana.
- Thank you.</font>

30
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,095
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you for today.</font>

31
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,398
<font color="#00ffff">Goodbye, Emma,</font>

32
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,000
<font color="#00ffff">Goodbye.</font>

33
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,285
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

34
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,836
<font color="#00ffff">My God.</font>

35
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,872
<font color="#00ffff">Jesus Christ.</font>

36
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,948
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana</font>

37
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,017
<font color="#00ffff">You arrived</font>

38
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,818
<font color="#00ffff">José.</font>

39
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,822
<font color="#00ffff">There are too many faces of mine here.</font>

40
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:59,259
<font color="#00ffff">If I told you I would
have been too shy.</font>

41
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,694
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

42
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,462
<font color="#00ffff">But you</font>

43
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,365
<font color="#00ffff">You are the best I have.</font>

44
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,602
<font color="#00ffff">Do you like them?</font>

45
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:13,273
<font color="#00ffff">They are very large.</font>

46
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,683
<font color="#00ffff">You're kidding</font>

47
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,088
<font color="#00ffff">Well, someone likes them.</font>

48
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,958
<font color="#00ffff">They want the 6.</font>

49
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,628
<font color="#00ffff">- The 6?
- I invite you to dinner today, okay?</font>

50
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,331
<font color="#00ffff">I'll be right back.</font>

51
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,230
<font color="#00ffff">Good photos.</font>

52
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,503
<font color="#00ffff">It was you, right?</font>

53
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,038
<font color="#00ffff">Did you just buy all this?</font>

54
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,408
<font color="#00ffff">You can not blame me.</font>

55
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,611
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you here?</font>

56
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,282
<font color="#00ffff">For you.</font>

57
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,055
<font color="#00ffff">Can we talk in private?</font>

58
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

59
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,159
<font color="#00ffff">Look, I'm not very
good at repentance.</font>

60
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,362
<font color="#00ffff">I never wanted to try it again.</font>

61
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,367
<font color="#00ffff">- Cristian, not a good idea.
- Let's just talk.</font>

62
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,337
<font color="#00ffff">Is it okay? Let's just talk, please.</font>

63
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,006
<font color="#00ffff">Dinner with me.</font>

64
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,315
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, I'll have dinner with you</font>

65
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,722
<font color="#00ffff">Because I'm hungry, but we'll
just talk and that's it.</font>

66
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,592
<font color="#00ffff">Do you want more time?</font>

67
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,893
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

68
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,996
<font color="#00ffff">Only one steak and potatoes. That is all.</font>

69
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,966
<font color="#00ffff">Actually, I want a salad.</font>

70
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,471
<font color="#00ffff">And two glasses of wine.</font>

71
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,211
<font color="#00ffff">We only serve it at the bar, sir.</font>

72
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,675
<font color="#00ffff">- A bottle then.
- Yes sir.</font>

73
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,577
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

74
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,982
<font color="#00ffff">Then, let's talk.</font>

75
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,322
<font color="#00ffff">I want you back.</font>

76
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,126
<font color="#00ffff">I would like to negotiate the terms.</font>

77
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,663
<font color="#00ffff">But I do not see how.</font>

78
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,735
<font color="#00ffff">You said it yourself, that's how you are.</font>

79
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,372
<font color="#00ffff">What happened last time
will not happen again.</font>

80
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,274
<font color="#00ffff">How can you say that?</font>

81
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:06,146
<font color="#00ffff">I know I asked you to show me</font>

82
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,048
<font color="#00ffff">how far it could go, but</font>

83
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,887
<font color="#00ffff">You enjoyed the pain you caused.</font>

84
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,526
<font color="#00ffff">That continues in you.</font>

85
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,595
<font color="#00ffff">I am working on that.</font>

86
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,764
<font color="#00ffff">Working on what?</font>

87
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,369
<font color="#00ffff">I can not do this if
you do not talk to me.</font>

88
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,106
<font color="#00ffff">What do you want to know?</font>

89
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,541
<font color="#00ffff">Everything.</font>

90
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,077
<font color="#00ffff">Good.</font>

91
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,627
<font color="#00ffff">I do it.</font>

92
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,051
<font color="#00ffff">My biological mother died
when I was 4 years old.</font>

93
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,542
<font color="#00ffff">I was addicted to crack.</font>

94
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,578
<font color="#00ffff">That fills some spaces.</font>

95
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,414
<font color="#00ffff">Why did not you tell me that?</font>

96
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:18,085
<font color="#00ffff">I did it but at that
moment you were asleep.</font>

97
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,655
<font color="#00ffff">It's okay.</font>

98
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,192
<font color="#00ffff">Generally,</font>

99
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:30,898
<font color="#00ffff">The key to communication is
that both parties are aware.</font>

100
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,336
<font color="#00ffff">I'm really sorry about your mother.</font>

101
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,874
<font color="#00ffff">It is in the past.</font>

102
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,479
<font color="#00ffff">Now, I brought you here to negotiate.</font>

103
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,382
<font color="#00ffff">Are you open to new terms?</font>

104
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:55,055
<font color="#00ffff">No rules, no punishment.</font>

105
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:04,198
<font color="#00ffff">No rules, no punishment and no secrets.</font>

106
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,367
<font color="#00ffff">I can do that.</font>

107
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,369
<font color="#00ffff">It would be a...</font>

108
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,838
<font color="#00ffff">How do you call it?</font>

109
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,040
<font color="#00ffff">A vanilla relationship?</font>

110
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,809
<font color="#00ffff">Do you say we will only do
what you are comfortable with?</font>

111
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,880
<font color="#00ffff">Do you need all these things?</font>

112
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,483
<font color="#00ffff">I need you more.</font>

113
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,168
<font color="#00ffff">A gift.</font>

114
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:11,164
<font color="#00ffff">This clicks. I like it.</font>

115
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,370
<font color="#00ffff">I'll call you tomorrow.</font>

116
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,541
<font color="#00ffff">It's okay. Goodnight.</font>

117
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,705
<font color="#00ffff">Dream with me</font>

118
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,450
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe. Thanks for this night.
See you, honey.</font>

119
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,894
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana.</font>

120
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,296
<font color="#00ffff">I have heard many things about you.</font>

121
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,433
<font color="#00ffff">Beware, Liz. This can read.</font>

122
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:20,968
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, Jack.</font>

123
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,570
<font color="#00ffff">What are you doing here?
We are in trouble?</font>

124
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,007
<font color="#00ffff">Not at all, I'm just here
to give you encouragement.</font>

125
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,011
<font color="#00ffff">Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lauries would come in handy.</font>

126
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,615
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry. Meetings. I would not go.</font>

127
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,350
<font color="#00ffff">Who is Laurie?</font>

128
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:40,254
<font color="#00ffff">It is a bar on the other street.
Very calm.</font>

129
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,723
<font color="#00ffff">You should come.</font>

130
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,826
<font color="#00ffff">Absolutely. After work.</font>

131
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,296
<font color="#00ffff">Lria but I have plans tonight.</font>

132
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:53,267
<font color="#00ffff">Then let your plan come with us.
Will be fast.</font>

133
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,069
<font color="#00ffff">Hello. Yes.</font>

134
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,108
<font color="#00ffff">Have fun.</font>

135
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,688
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, have we met before?</font>

136
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,324
<font color="#00ffff">It's okay.</font>

137
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,359
<font color="#00ffff">I am nobody.</font>

138
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,762
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, Lauries is here.</font>

139
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,664
<font color="#00ffff">Come on, I invite.</font>

140
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,904
<font color="#00ffff">Very well, here we go.</font>

141
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:32,673
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

142
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,107

144
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:39,847
<font color="#00ffff">Your comments about the
book were interesting.</font>

145
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,449
<font color="#00ffff">I do not usually like
political intrigues.</font>

146

<font color="#00ffff">That's great.</font>

147

152
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,742

158
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,131
<font color="#00ffff">It is my boss, Cristian,
You have to calm down.</font>

159
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,368
<font color="#00ffff">Calm down is not my strong point.</font>

160
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,639
<font color="#00ffff">I know something that can help.</font>

you went shopping?</font>

163
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,119
<font color="#00ffff">The weekend.</font>

169
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,293
<font color="#00ffff">I have it.</font>

170
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,395
<font color="#00ffff">It's okay.</font>

171
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,701
<font color="#00ffff">I know what you're doing.</font>

<font color="#00ffff">What? I try cooking.</font>

173
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,838
<font color="#00ffff">Just ask.</font>

174
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,311
<font color="#00ffff">I think we should go slowly.</font>

175
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,814
<font color="#00ffff">It's okay.</font>

176
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,983
<font color="#00ffff">- It's okay.
- It's okay.</font>

177

<font color="#00ffff">Tell me about SAP. How are you?</font>

178
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,226
<font color="#00ffff">It's okay.</font>

179
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,596
<font color="#00ffff">Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.</font>

180
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,799
<font color="#00ffff">- How is morality.
- Moral?</font>

181
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,793
<font color="#00ffff">You say as if we were sitting in a circle</font>

182
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,835
<font color="#00ffff">to sing the company
song in the mornings?</font>

183
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,439
<font color="#00ffff">I just want to lead
people who are happy.</font>

184

- What?</font>

185
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,212
<font color="#00ffff">Are you going to buy SAP?</font>

186
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,282
<font color="#00ffff">No, you can not do that, it's my job.</font>

187
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,751
<font color="#00ffff">You can not start
interfering with my career.</font>

188
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,352
<font color="#00ffff">That's not why.</font>

189
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,833
<font color="#00ffff">I have wanted to expand
to the publishers,</font>

190
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,622
<font color="#00ffff">They fit.</font>

191
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,526
<font color="#00ffff">But you would be my boss.</font>

192
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,029
<font color="#00ffff">Technically it would be the
head of the head of your boss,</font>

193
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,632
<font color="#00ffff">And I will be sleeping
with the boss of my boss?</font>

<font color="#00ffff">Loud, really? Ldiota.</font>

196
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,453
<font color="#00ffff">You know that's out of bounds.</font>

197
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:11,925
<font color="#00ffff">I will need a map.</font>

198
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:35,148
<font color="#00ffff">I thought you wanted to go slow.</font>

199
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:42,222
<font color="#00ffff">What do you want Marianastasia?</font>

200
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,327
<font color="#00ffff">To communicate you have to talk to me.</font>

201
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:52,799
<font color="#00ffff">I love you.</font>

202
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,018
<font color="#00ffff">I have lots of clothes.</font>

203
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,298
<font color="#00ffff">Continue.</font>

204
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:51,225
<font color="#00ffff">Kiss me.</font>

205
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,728
<font color="#00ffff">What do you want Marianastasia?</font>

206
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,667
<font color="#00ffff">I want everything from you.</font>

207
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,942
<font color="#00ffff">Why did you wait so long?</font>

208
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,379
<font color="#00ffff">For sex.</font>

209
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:32,059
<font color="#00ffff">Read Auten and Bronte.
And nobody got there.</font>

210
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,732
<font color="#00ffff">I guess I was waiting for
something exceptional.</font>

211
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:43,637
<font color="#00ffff">Then I met you.</font>

212
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:50,611
<font color="#00ffff">Very well Miss Austen.
What do you think of this?</font>

213
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:56,950
<font color="#00ffff">I was being romantic and you
distract me with your bizarre sex.</font>

214
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:03,457
<font color="#00ffff">Bizarre sex? I do not know what that
is, but I like the way it sounds.</font>

215
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:44,031
<font color="#00ffff">You were so gentle that I
did not want to wake you.</font>

216
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:49,837
<font color="#00ffff">Not much for breakfast.</font>

217
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,439
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

218

when I asked for my car.</font>

- Okay, thank you.</font>

225
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,427
<font color="#00ffff">Why do you have the details
of my bank account?</font>

226
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:52,666
<font color="#00ffff">- How can you have breakfast here? "Christian, how do you know that?"</font>

227
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,039
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

charity ball tonight.</font>

230
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:09,983
<font color="#00ffff">You probably have to appear.
Why do not you come with me?</font>

231
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:13,687
<font color="#00ffff">You probably have to appear.
Why do not you come with me?</font>

232
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,691
<font color="#00ffff">I've never been to a dance.</font>

233
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:23,197
<font color="#00ffff">I do not have a dress for that. Besides
what am I going to do with my hair?</font>

234
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:28,602
<font color="#00ffff">I own a show. Do not worry about
the dress, I'll take care of that.</font>

235
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,739
<font color="#00ffff">What happens?</font>

236
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:38,278
<font color="#00ffff">There was a girl standing outside and
I was out of my office yesterday.</font>

237
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,884
<font color="#00ffff">I knew my name and I had a benda
on the wrist, it was very strange.</font>

238
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:48,488
<font color="#00ffff">We must go.</font>

239
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:07,341
<font color="#00ffff">Hi, how are you? I brought my girlfriend...</font>

did you bring me here?</font>

244

woman who seduced and abused you?</font>

245
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:07,258
<font color="#00ffff">Our relationship ended years
ago, we are just friends.</font>

246
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:11,538

someone will fix your hair...</font>

Explain what is happening.</font>

my sub one time, about 2 years ago,</font>

become, I did not know you were different.</font>

277
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:45,292
<font color="#00ffff">Different? Really?</font>

278
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,195
<font color="#00ffff">That's why you took me to Mrs.
Robinson?</font>

279
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:51,632
<font color="#00ffff">Where do you take all your women?
Why am I so different?</font>

280
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:58,172
<font color="#00ffff">- It was wrong, I admit it.
- Everything is wrong. All this.</font>

281
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:06,639
<font color="#00ffff">You put money in my account that I do not
want, You bought the company in which I work.</font>

282
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:12,019
<font color="#00ffff">This is not a Christian
relationship, it is possession.</font>

283
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:20,786
<font color="#00ffff">I am trying to understand you.
I want to get close to you.</font>

284
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:27,201
<font color="#00ffff">But it is very difficult if you
keep doing these rare things.</font>

285
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:32,439
<font color="#00ffff">And it is very difficult if you do not let me touch you.</font>

286
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:41,481
<font color="#00ffff">Come to my room.</font>

287
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:46,186
<font color="#00ffff">Sex will not fix this
now, are you crazy?</font>

288
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,456
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana, please.</font>

289
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:56,530
<font color="#00ffff">You wanted a map.</font>

290
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,846
<font color="#00ffff">Start here.</font>

291
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:48,749
<font color="#00ffff">That's the limit.</font>

292
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:55,289
<font color="#00ffff">I can live with that.</font>

293
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,559
<font color="#00ffff">Then I'm all yours.</font>

294
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:07,568
<font color="#00ffff">Mr. Gray, your date is here.</font>

295
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:11,371
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, send it to Mariana's room.</font>

296
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:15,943
<font color="#00ffff">- It is here.
- Who is here?</font>

297
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:26,353
<font color="#00ffff">Wao, I think it should go like this,
you're going to be beautiful.</font>

298
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,656
<font color="#00ffff">Christian?</font>

299
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:35,829
<font color="#00ffff">Chao, beautiful.</font>

300
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:28,415
<font color="#00ffff">- Would you stay there looking arrogant?
- Yes, I think that will.</font>

301
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:53,899
<font color="#00ffff">I was thinking that it would be much
more stimulating if you used these.</font>

302
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,115
<font color="#00ffff">How am I supposed to use them?</font>

303
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:10,057
<font color="#00ffff">Well, we have to clean them first.
Curious?</font>

304
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:19,099
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, open your mouth.</font>

305
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,942
<font color="#00ffff">Good.</font>

306
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,347
<font color="#00ffff">Now bend over.</font>

307
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:38,218
<font color="#00ffff">No, you're not going to put that in my ass.</font>

308
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:01,742
<font color="#00ffff">Quiet.</font>

309
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,919
<font color="#00ffff">Let's see how you're doing.</font>

310
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:22,796
<font color="#00ffff">How do you feel?</font>

311
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:26,934
<font color="#00ffff">Rare...</font>

312
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:29,937
<font color="#00ffff">but well.</font>

313

- You will discover it.</font>

314
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:43,917

will look good with these.</font>

315
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:50,824
<font color="#00ffff">Two more are for your ears.</font>

316
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:15,382
<font color="#00ffff">- Did I mention that it was a masked ball?
- No.</font>

317
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:22,623
<font color="#00ffff">Do your bodyguards
have to use them too?</font>

318
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:27,027
<font color="#00ffff">It's for safety, you will
not even notice they are.</font>

319
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,797
<font color="#00ffff">Come on.</font>

- Hello.</font>

323
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:30,123

mysterious. And also very annoying.</font>

324
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:33,026
<font color="#00ffff">You look spectacular.</font>

325
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,930
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you, you too, that
dress is so beautiful.</font>

326
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:41,935
<font color="#00ffff">I am so glad that you came back with
Christian, I was lost without you.</font>

- No more missing</font>

328
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:07,353

- Mia.</font>

329
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:12,933
<font color="#00ffff">- You changed your hair.
- Yes, a new image, do you like it?</font>

330
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,638
<font color="#00ffff">- Well, it is very bold.
- How do you stand it?</font>

he was expelled from 4 different schools.</font>

<font color="#00ffff">For fighting, yes, it was
totally out of control.</font>

333
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,384

I'll be right back.</font>

guide him to his true self.</font>

He would tell you the same thing.</font>

377

<font color="#00ffff">Do you think you're the first
woman who wants to save him?</font>

378
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:02,803
<font color="#00ffff">He needs submission into his
life, not just in his room.</font>

379
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:08,442
<font color="#00ffff">No, it is changing. He does not want that anymore.</font>

380
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:14,281
<font color="#00ffff">But it is what you need. And you do not look
like the kind of woman who wants to be tied up.</font>

381
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:18,051
<font color="#00ffff">If you really want to make him
happy, if you want to be happy.</font>

382
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:20,487
<font color="#00ffff">You will let it go.</font>

383
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:25,492
<font color="#00ffff">There is no way that someone like
you could understand what we have.</font>

<font color="#00ffff">Whatever happens between me and
Christian, it's not your damn business.</font>

386
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:39,740
<font color="#00ffff">So get away from it a fucking time.</font>

387
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:49,650

- Not now.</font>

388

<font color="#00ffff">What did Elena tell you?</font>

389
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:09,703
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing I did not know.</font>

390
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:18,679
<font color="#00ffff">- You can take me to my house.
- Stay with me tonight.</font>

391
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:32,659
<font color="#00ffff">Wake up, we're home.</font>

392
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,502
<font color="#00ffff">Lord.</font>

393
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,671
<font color="#00ffff">Stay here.</font>

394
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:16,069
<font color="#00ffff">What happened? That's my car,
what happened to my car?</font>

395
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:19,740
<font color="#00ffff">- Taylor, can you cover me?
- Yes sir, right away.</font>

396
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:25,212
<font color="#00ffff">Where are we going? Christian.</font>

397
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:32,619
<font color="#00ffff">Do you think it was Lena? Do you really
think I would do something like that?</font>

398
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:39,860
<font color="#00ffff">I do not see why we can not go back to
your apartment, it's like a fortress.</font>

399
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,332
<font color="#00ffff">- There is no way I have entered.
- I had no way to enter the garage either.</font>

400
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:48,402
<font color="#00ffff">I will not risk it.</font>

401
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:59,346
<font color="#00ffff">- Will the night pass?
- Yes.</font>

402
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:03,050
<font color="#00ffff">The crew will watch.</font>

403
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:12,226
<font color="#00ffff">If something happens to you because of me...</font>

404
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:17,197
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing will happen to me.</font>

405
00:48:23,871 --> 00:48:26,974
<font color="#00ffff">Can I take that away?</font>

406
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:34,281
<font color="#00ffff">- Do not leave the lines.
- It's okay.</font>

407
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,747
<font color="#00ffff">Are they burns?</font>

408
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:10,317
<font color="#00ffff">Who did this to you?</font>

409
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,755
<font color="#00ffff">Come on, we're done.</font>

410
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:23,830
<font color="#00ffff">How hard it is for you,</font>

411
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:28,602
<font color="#00ffff">open with me and...</font>

412
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:31,038
<font color="#00ffff">talk to me about these things.</font>

413
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:40,080
<font color="#00ffff">So you try everything,
that means you love me.</font>

414
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:45,719
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I love you.</font>

415
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,717
<font color="#00ffff">So here is where you learned
your skills with knots.</font>

416
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,318
<font color="#00ffff">Good morning.</font>

417
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:21,588
<font color="#00ffff">- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.</font>

418
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,393
<font color="#00ffff">This boat is very beautiful.</font>

419
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,130
<font color="#00ffff">- It belongs to my company.
- Did you build it?</font>

420
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:34,368
<font color="#00ffff">I had a little help. Her name is Grace.</font>

421
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,838
<font color="#00ffff">Like your mom?</font>

422
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:42,776
<font color="#00ffff">- Why does it surprise you?
- You're always so cold around you.</font>

423
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:49,616
<font color="#00ffff">I owe my life to Dolores. I was saved
when my biological mother died.</font>

424
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:55,756
<font color="#00ffff">- Remember your biological mother?
- I try to avoid it.</font>

425
00:50:57,658 --> 00:51:02,996
<font color="#00ffff">- What happened to him?
- Overdose.</font>

426
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:05,866
<font color="#00ffff">They found their body 3 days later.</font>

427
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,938
<font color="#00ffff">- Where were you?
- With her.</font>

428
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:14,575
<font color="#00ffff">My God.</font>

429
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:19,012
<font color="#00ffff">They took me to the hospital.</font>

430
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:22,549
<font color="#00ffff">Grace was there.</font>

431
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:27,788
<font color="#00ffff">Thanks for telling me.</font>

432
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:38,858
<font color="#00ffff">Look at that house, it's beautiful.
The views must be incredible,</font>

433
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,435
<font color="#00ffff">I wonder who will live there.</font>

434
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:45,772
<font color="#00ffff">The widow of a sailor.
He lost his husband years ago.</font>

435
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:49,343
<font color="#00ffff">He stops at the window every night,
waiting for him to come back.</font>

436
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:54,848
<font color="#00ffff">- Did you just make that up?
- Yes.</font>

437
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:59,086
<font color="#00ffff">- I want you to take the helm.
- I.</font>

438
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:02,289
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, you. Come on.</font>

439
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:42,362
<font color="#00ffff">- Do not let go. No.
- I'm right here.</font>

440
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,966
<font color="#00ffff">- It's okay.
- It's okay.</font>

441
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:06,053
<font color="#00ffff">Oh my God, my God, I am doing it.
I am the captain.</font>

442
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:21,768
<font color="#00ffff">- Hello Jack.
- Hello.</font>

443
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:24,838
<font color="#00ffff">Are personal calls, in
your spare time, okay?</font>

444
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:35,649
<font color="#00ffff">- Yes.
- Did you get my message?</font>

445
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:40,354
<font color="#00ffff">They called you this morning.
A meeting at 9AM.</font>

446
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:44,291
<font color="#00ffff">- Shit.
- I'm going to move it.</font>

447
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:47,828
<font color="#00ffff">Did you book our
rooms in New York?</font>

448
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:51,798
<font color="#00ffff">- Excuse me?
- The book fair is Friday.</font>

449
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:55,369
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I know, book
your room, of course.</font>

450
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:59,806
<font color="#00ffff">And yours, I suspect
I'll need an assistant.</font>

451
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,677
<font color="#00ffff">I did not know that, I'm sorry.</font>

452
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,713
<font color="#00ffff">Do not apologize, just
get yourself a room.</font>

453
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:14,154
<font color="#00ffff">Unless you want to stay with your
boyfriend, it's not like you need the job.</font>

454
00:54:16,056 --> 00:54:20,194
<font color="#00ffff">- I will solve it.
- Is it Jack, how was the weekend?</font>

455
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:25,265
<font color="#00ffff">Do not tell me...</font>

456
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:44,451
<font color="#00ffff">This weekend I'm going to New York.</font>

457
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:58,498
<font color="#00ffff">Are you bored?</font>

458
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:06,507
<font color="#00ffff">It's for work, I need to do this.
- The answer is no.</font>

459
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:18,418
<font color="#00ffff">- I was not asking permission.
- We will discuss this...</font>

460
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:36,737
<font color="#00ffff">Hello.</font>

461
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:40,774
<font color="#00ffff">Christian?</font>

462
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:46,480
<font color="#00ffff">- Oh, my God. "I'm sorry Miss Steel, did I scare you?"</font>

463
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,986
<font color="#00ffff">- No, no, you were very... silent.
- I am Mrs. Johnson, the housekeeper.</font>

464
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:56,390
<font color="#00ffff">- Allow me?
- Insurance.</font>

465
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:04,231
<font color="#00ffff">I am Mariana, but you already know, because
you should have seen me last week.</font>

466
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:07,501
<font color="#00ffff">Mr. Gary is in the
studio, making a call.</font>

467
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,537
<font color="#00ffff">I'll be in the kitchen if I need anything.</font>

468
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,023
<font color="#00ffff">Do you see something that you like?</font>

469
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:42,896
<font color="#00ffff">The door was unlocked.</font>

470
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:46,934
<font color="#00ffff">I will have to talk to Mrs. Johnson.</font>

471
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:55,401
<font color="#00ffff">Do you enter often?
To... shake the dust?</font>

472
00:57:56,743 --> 00:57:59,646
<font color="#00ffff">These are for the pesones.</font>

473
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:07,054
<font color="#00ffff">Come here, give me your hand.</font>

474
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:20,467
<font color="#00ffff">It is even more intense if you remove them.</font>

475
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:37,117
<font color="#00ffff">What is this?</font>

476
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:43,323
<font color="#00ffff">- Okay, enough demonstration.
- What is this?</font>

477
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:51,031
<font color="#00ffff">- Nothing to worry about.
- I kind of like it.</font>

478
00:58:54,401 --> 00:59:02,401
<font color="#00ffff">The last time we did this, you saw
another side of me, and you left.</font>

479
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:07,281
<font color="#00ffff">The last time was different.</font>

480
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:16,423
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, but not here.</font>

481
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:22,062
<font color="#00ffff">- Mrs. Johnson.
- Oh my goodness.</font>

482
01:00:56,290 --> 01:01:01,728
<font color="#00ffff">- You are mine.
- I'm yours.</font>

483
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,993
<font color="#00ffff">- Ready?
- Yes.</font>

484
01:01:57,784 --> 01:02:00,287
<font color="#00ffff">You know we have to
talk about New York.</font>

485
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:03,123
<font color="#00ffff">What do we have to talk about?</font>

486
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,126
<font color="#00ffff">That you have forgotten does not
mean that we will not speak.</font>

487
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:10,998
<font color="#00ffff">If you want to go to New York, we can go,
let me take you, I have a place there.</font>

488
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:16,170
<font color="#00ffff">Of course, if these are not
holidays, it is a working trip</font>

489
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,039
<font color="#00ffff">with my boss, whom I want to impress.</font>

490
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:24,444
<font color="#00ffff">You knew it had 3 attendees, all in 18
months and resigned without warning.</font>

491
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:27,915
<font color="#00ffff">- You do not think I can handle it.
- Is not that.</font>

492
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:31,552
<font color="#00ffff">That's what it looks like.</font>

493
01:02:31,852 --> 01:02:35,689
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana, I know you can
deal with anything... and</font>

494
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:43,997
<font color="#00ffff">If you really want to go, I can not
stop you. But I would like to take you.</font>

495
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:51,905
<font color="#00ffff">- It's okay.
- It's okay?</font>

496
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:58,078
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, of course I'd rather
meet New York with you.</font>

497
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:02,449
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I hate fighting.</font>

498
01:03:02,516 --> 01:03:09,756
<font color="#00ffff">That was not a fight. It was a
conversation, when someone speaks,</font>

499
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:14,728
<font color="#00ffff">- the other listens and they come to
an agreement, - this is how it works.</font>

500
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:17,431
<font color="#00ffff">Is it crazy, is not it?</font>

501
01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:22,402
<font color="#00ffff">- Adios Mariana.
- Bye.</font>

502
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:38,919
<font color="#00ffff">- I'm with Taylor outside.
- I'll be there in 2 minutes.</font>

503
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,096
<font color="#00ffff">Are you leaving?</font>

504
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:53,834
<font color="#00ffff">In fact, I was about to
talk to you about New York.</font>

505
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:56,637
<font color="#00ffff">Is there a problem?</font>

506
01:03:57,037 --> 01:04:04,444
<font color="#00ffff">I am very grateful for the opportunity Jack
but I have made plans that I can not change.</font>

507
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:10,150
<font color="#00ffff">But I will not leave my phone, so if
you need anything, it is available.</font>

508
01:04:10,784 --> 01:04:13,820
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana, take a seat.</font>

509
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,293
<font color="#00ffff">I really regret it.</font>

510
01:04:21,762 --> 01:04:24,131
<font color="#00ffff">Mariana I think you have
enormous potential.</font>

511
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:29,336
<font color="#00ffff">But I do not want to waste my time with
someone who does not take this job seriously.</font>

512
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:33,307
<font color="#00ffff">I do... this is the
work of my dreams.</font>

513
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,110
<font color="#00ffff">And is not New York and that
Expo part of your dream?</font>

514
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:42,950
<font color="#00ffff">It is, it is. But it was just a
misunderstanding. It will not happen again.</font>

515
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:47,688
<font color="#00ffff">Because there are a lot of qualified
people who would kill for this job.</font>

516
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:55,362
<font color="#00ffff">- Look, I'm a pretty good teacher.
- Sure you are.</font>

517
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:59,566
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not seeing the
initiative on your part.</font>

518
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:08,767
<font color="#00ffff">I do more than you ask and...
I'm talking about going further.</font>

519
01:05:10,644 --> 01:05:18,644
<font color="#00ffff">Unless you want me to compete with
Christian Gray, for your attention.</font>

520
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:26,927
<font color="#00ffff">I apologize if Christian was not very
polite to you the other night, that's what?</font>

521
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:34,001
<font color="#00ffff">Your boyfriend has a reputation
for being a bit rude,</font>

522
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,403
<font color="#00ffff">Is that what you like?</font>

523
01:05:36,737 --> 01:05:39,606
<font color="#00ffff">If you have a problem with my
work we can see it with Richard.</font>

524
01:05:39,873 --> 01:05:43,343
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you so serious?</font>

525
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,413
<font color="#00ffff">What do you think I'm going
to do, force you to fuck me?</font>

526
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:48,348
<font color="#00ffff">Jack</font>

527
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:53,453
<font color="#00ffff">I just think...</font>

528
01:05:54,221 --> 01:06:00,227
<font color="#00ffff">that if you want to get up for fucking someone,
you should do it with someone well connected,</font>

529
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:07,601
<font color="#00ffff">- not just rich, right?
- No.</font>

530
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,737
<font color="#00ffff">Not what?</font>

531
01:06:11,104 --> 01:06:19,104
<font color="#00ffff">This is a serious question, do you
want to stay and be taken seriously?</font>

532
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:27,187
<font color="#00ffff">I would like to leave, Jack, please.</font>

533
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:36,956
<font color="#00ffff">I can make you pray like no one else has.
Neither he nor anyone else.</font>

534
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:58,051
<font color="#00ffff">Jack, Hyde, jack.,. I try to touch myself...</font>

535
01:06:58,118 --> 01:07:02,689
<font color="#00ffff">- I'm going to kill him. "No, please stay, do not leave me."</font>

536
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:10,664
<font color="#00ffff">- I left it lying on the floor,
- Okay, let's go home.</font>

537
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:18,238
<font color="#00ffff">Then your pass has been canceled.
All right. No, thanks Richard, good night.</font>

538
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:26,980
<font color="#00ffff">They already took care of him. He has been fired.</font>

539
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:36,590
<font color="#00ffff">How, I thought the
deal was not over.</font>

540
01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:39,693
<font color="#00ffff">It is not. But I know the CEO.</font>

541
01:07:40,093 --> 01:07:44,798
<font color="#00ffff">I told him what happened. You
will not have to see it again.</font>

542
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:48,535
<font color="#00ffff">Will I have a job, now that he is not?</font>

543
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:53,340
<font color="#00ffff">- It does not matter if you do not have it...
- Christian, I love to work.</font>

544
01:07:53,974 --> 01:07:57,144
<font color="#00ffff">You can not keep me
locked in your Penthause.</font>

545
01:08:00,714 --> 01:08:05,252
<font color="#00ffff">What if I give you a key?</font>

546
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:12,693
<font color="#00ffff">I mean... and if you had a key, and
you bring some of your things, all...</font>

547
01:08:13,026 --> 01:08:18,765
<font color="#00ffff">And you fall asleep, you know... not in your house.</font>

548
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:24,538
<font color="#00ffff">Are you asking me to move with you?</font>

549
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:32,546
<font color="#00ffff">- Are you sure?
- Yes.</font>

550
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:40,053
<font color="#00ffff">I want you here all the time.
As soon as possible.</font>

551
01:08:45,726 --> 01:08:49,263
<font color="#00ffff">What happened to learning
to walk before running?</font>

552
01:08:49,997 --> 01:08:55,269
<font color="#00ffff">Well, is that one of the many things
we can talk about at breakfast?</font>

553
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:04,411
<font color="#00ffff">- Can I think?
- Insurance</font>

554
01:09:14,188 --> 01:09:18,659
<font color="#00ffff">- Liz, hello. "Mariana, you heard, Jack resigned last night.</font>

555
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:23,197
<font color="#00ffff">It was a bit rushed, we have a lot
of work now, so we are screwed.</font>

556
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:25,399
<font color="#00ffff">They do not need me, then.</font>

557
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:27,777
<font color="#00ffff">We are trying to find
someone temporarily,</font>

558
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:31,839
<font color="#00ffff">- .., can you go to the meeting by Jack?
- The publishers meeting?</font>

559
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,442
<font color="#00ffff">You know the job that Jack did.</font>

560
01:09:35,776 --> 01:09:38,312
<font color="#00ffff">Good, but...</font>

561
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,650
<font color="#00ffff">You're right, it's too much.</font>

562
01:09:44,651 --> 01:09:49,790
<font color="#00ffff">No, I can do it.
Okay, I can do it.</font>

563
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:53,527
<font color="#00ffff">Fantastic.</font>

564
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:57,231
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, call me when you're done.</font>

565
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:02,669
<font color="#00ffff">We should print few titles,
stay with the known authors.</font>

566
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,038
<font color="#00ffff">Concentrate on the audience we have.</font>

567
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:08,208
<font color="#00ffff">- Or expand it.
- Sorry?</font>

568
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:12,846
<font color="#00ffff">So Mariana, who do you
think we should publish?</font>

569
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:19,653
<font color="#00ffff">New voices, besides
the known authors.</font>

570
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,024
<font color="#00ffff">For example, Fox got
80000 tickets last week.</font>

571
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:25,391
<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

572
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:29,663
<font color="#00ffff">Online tickets are not automatically
converted into print sales.</font>

573
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:34,134
<font color="#00ffff">But they could be. Its
audience is 18 to 24 years,</font>

574
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:37,471
<font color="#00ffff">that is exactly the readers
that we must pursue.</font>

575
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:42,643
<font color="#00ffff">I can teach them, I think it's worth it.</font>

576
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:47,548
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe we should take a look.</font>

577
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:58,525
<font color="#00ffff">Good idea.</font>

578
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,531
<font color="#00ffff">- Mariana, a moment.
- I'm very sorry, I missed the mark.</font>

579
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:07,734
<font color="#00ffff">Do not feel it, it makes a lot of sense.</font>

580
01:11:08,035 --> 01:11:15,209
<font color="#00ffff">- What will you do now that Jack Hyde left?
- Liz mentioned that they are looking for something...</font>

581
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:18,579
<font color="#00ffff">Well, why do not you take
on Jack, temporarily.</font>

582
01:11:19,646 --> 01:11:23,550
<font color="#00ffff">Well, great.</font>

583
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:30,958
<font color="#00ffff">- For the new AP fiction publisher,
- Temporary editor.</font>

584
01:11:31,725 --> 01:11:33,827
<font color="#00ffff">They know how good you are.</font>

585
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:43,103
<font color="#00ffff">- Christian, did you have something to do with this? "No, it was just you."</font>

586
01:11:44,838 --> 01:11:48,809
<font color="#00ffff">- Do not you believe me?
- I do not believe in myself.</font>

587
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:57,417
<font color="#00ffff">I asked you a question last night.
- About living with you?</font>

588
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:09,889
<font color="#00ffff">I think probably... I should bring
some things from my apartment.</font>

589
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:16,670
<font color="#00ffff">- We can fix it.
- All right.</font>

590
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:24,878
<font color="#00ffff">Now maybe we can move
this celebration home.</font>

591
01:12:25,612 --> 01:12:28,448
<font color="#00ffff">The account, please.</font>

592
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:42,529
<font color="#00ffff">Take off your panties, now.</font>

593
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,835
<font color="#00ffff">- Right here?
- Here. Now.</font>

594
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,289
<font color="#00ffff">Do you like that?</font>

595
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:39,079
<font color="#00ffff">Do not jump,</font>

596
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,306
<font color="#00ffff">And .. Jeremy has to
sign those documents.</font>

597
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:09,843
<font color="#00ffff">I've been asking
Jack to do that.</font>

598
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:11,945
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, but Jack is a bit vague.</font>

599
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:17,017
<font color="#00ffff">- Did not you know that?
- Yes. I think he calls it tempered.</font>

600
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,056
<font color="#00ffff">- Thanks Hannah - Yes.</font>

601
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:33,934
<font color="#00ffff">Ye, it's great that you're doing this, but
- Very weird I know, I know.</font>

602
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:37,769
<font color="#00ffff">I'm just saying .. do you expect
me to call you Miss Steel?</font>

603
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,864
<font color="#00ffff">I hope you call me Mariana.</font>

604
01:15:40,774 --> 01:15:45,012
<font color="#00ffff">And I do not expect you to prepare me
coffee, unless you do it for yourself.</font>

605
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:52,853
<font color="#00ffff">And... the rest only ..
We will see by the way. All right?</font>

606
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:55,122
<font color="#00ffff">Good.</font>

I leave right away. - Then I'll go with you.</font>

610
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,352
<font color="#00ffff">No, it's fine. It will only be a second.
I will be right back.</font>

611
01:16:27,688 --> 01:16:28,989
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>
